## Introduction

Secret Friends is a classic game that's played with a group of coworkers, classmates, family, or friends. The goal is to get a group of people together, pick someone at random, and give them a gift.

## How it works?
### Features
1. Type in the contestants' names:

![Friends-list](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84b9d483-023d-448a-b0e8-7f98714b88c5)

2. If you want, you can take the contestants who won't play off the list:

![Delete-friend](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86bf6d9f-5025-4129-9a23-2d19e2588b26)

3. Once you've got the contestants' names on the list, just pick one at random:

![Random-friend](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f71e4f2-a520-48e0-bcad-03ae43ed455f)

<strong>There you go! You've picked a friend</strong>

### Warnings
